# 🐍 Reinforcement Learning Snake Game  

### 🤖 Teaching a Snake to Think Using AI!  

This project is an **AI-powered Snake game** where the snake **learns** to survive, eat food, and avoid obstacles using **Reinforcement Learning**. Instead of traditional game logic, this snake **trains itself** over time using an intelligent **Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model**! 🎮

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **AI-Powered Snake** – Learns through trial & error using Reinforcement Learning  
✅ **Neural Network with PyTorch** – Implements Deep Q-Learning for decision-making  
✅ **Real-time Training Graph** 📈 – Tracks the AI’s progress within the game window  
✅ **Smooth Pygame Interface** – Interactive visualization of the AI’s gameplay

The AI starts off clueless (crashing into walls like a rookie), but over time, it **learns** to:  
✔ Navigate better  
✔ Find food efficiently  
✔ Avoid self-collisions  
✔ Survive longer

## 🎯 How It Works  

1️⃣ The snake starts by taking **random moves** 🏃  
2️⃣ The AI uses **Deep Q-Learning** to **maximize rewards** (eating food, avoiding death)  
3️⃣ Over time, it **learns from mistakes** and improves its survival skills  
4️⃣ A **graph** inside the game window visualizes the AI's training progress 📈

## 📌 Future Improvements  

🔹 Fine-tune the model for **even smarter gameplay**  
🔹 Add **different difficulty levels**  
🔹 Implement **multiplayer mode** (AI vs Human 🏆)  
🔹 Train AI on **more complex environments**
